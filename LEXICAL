    - # to end-of-line
    - or "REM" to end-of-line?

line continuation:
    - -> as first non-whitespace on next line
    - applies to the code before the | (if any) in the line above

identifiers:
    - letters, digits, underscore (not starting with digit)
    - global (module level) start with Capital
        - no, declared with "global" like python...
    - strings end with $
    - booleans end with ?
    - integers start with i-n (I-N for globals)
    - else float
    - arrays are dimensioned

literals:
    - strings:
        - string literals use double quotes, all on one line
        - embedded double quotes must be doubled
        - no other escaping is provided (e.g., no \ escapes like \n)
        - no string literal concatenation
        - no embedded variable substitutions (as part of the literal)
    - integers:
        - [digit]+
        - no support for different bases
    - floats:
        - standard float literal formats
        - fractional
            - digit*.digit+/digit+
    - units (follow literal):
        - all units are part of the literal representation and are converted
          to a common base unit so that the resulting literal value no longer
          has a unit associated with it
        - lengths (in, mm, cm, m, ft)
            - converted to inches
        - time (sec, msec, usec, nsec, min)
            - converted to seconds
        - angles (degrees, radians, rotations)
            - converted to degrees
        - force (oz, lbs, newtons (N), dynes (dyn))
            - converted to lbs
        - mass (oz, lbs, grams, kgrams)
            - converted to lbs
        - acceleration
            - g
        - percent (%)
            - divided by 100
